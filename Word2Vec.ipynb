    "Image and audio processing systems work with rich, high-dimensional datasets encoded as vectors of the individual raw pixel-intensities for image data, thus all the information is encoded in the data hence the relation between various entities in the system like (cats and dogs) can be established.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, when it comes to natural language processing systems traditionally it treats words as discrete atomic symbols, and therefore ‘cat’ may be represented as Id537 and ‘dog’ as Id143.These encodings are arbitrary, and provide no useful information to the system regarding the relationships that may exist between the individual symbols. This means that the model can leverage very little of what it has learned about ‘cats’ when it is processing data about ‘dogs’ (such that they are both animals, four-legged, pets, etc).\n",

    "Representing words as unique, discrete ids furthermore leads to data sparsity, and usually means that we may need more data in order to successfully train statistical models. Using vector representations can overcome some of these obstacles."

    "The purpose and usefulness of Word2vec is to group the vectors of similar words together in vectorspace. That is, it detects similarities mathematically. Word2vec creates vectors that are distributed numerical representations of word features, features such as the context of individual words. It does so without human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given enough data, usage and contexts, Word2vec can make highly accurate guesses about a word’s meaning based on past appearances. Those guesses can be used to establish a word’s association with other words (e.g. “man” is to “boy” what “woman” is to “girl”), or cluster documents and classify them by topic. Those clusters can form the basis of search, sentiment analysis and recommendations in such diverse fields as scientific research, legal discovery, e-commerce and customer relationship management.\n",

    "It does so in one of two ways, either using context to predict a target word (a method known as continuous bag of words, or CBOW), or using a word to predict a target context, which is called skip-gram. We use the latter method because it produces more accurate results on large datasets\n",

    "The Skip-gram model architecture usually tries to achieve the reverse of what the CBOW model does. It tries to predict the source context words (surrounding words) given a target word (the center word). Considering our simple sentence from earlier, “the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog”. If we used the CBOW model, we get pairs of (context_window, target_word)where if we consider a context window of size 2, we have examples like ([quick, fox], brown), ([the, brown], quick), ([the, dog], lazy) and so on. Now considering that the skip-gram model’s aim is to predict the context from the target word, the model typically inverts the contexts and targets, and tries to predict each context word from its target word. Hence the task becomes to predict the context [quick, fox] given target word ‘brown’ or [the, brown] given target word ‘quick’ and so on. Thus the model tries to predict the context_window words based on the target_word"

If it is a positive sample the word has contextual meaning, is a context wordand our label Y=1, else if it is a negative sample, the word has no contextual meaning, is just a random word and our label Y=0. We will pass each of them to an embedding layer of their own, having size (vocab_size x embed_size) which will give us dense word embeddings for each of these two words (1 x embed_size for each word). Next up we use a merge layer to compute the dot product of these two embeddings and get the dot product value. This is then sent to the dense sigmoid layer which outputs either a 1 or 0. We compare this with the actual label Y (1 or 0), compute the loss, backpropagate the errors to adjust the weights (in the embedding layer) and repeat this process for all (target, context) pairs for multiple epochs.
